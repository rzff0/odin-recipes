		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Butter:</strong> These traditional basted eggs are cooked in butter on the stove.</li>
			<li><strong>Eggs:</strong> This recipe makes two basted eggs. You can easily adjust the measurements to make more or less.</li>
			<li><strong>Water:</strong> A tablespoon of water helps steam the top of the egg.</li>
			<li><strong>Seasoning:</strong> When the eggs are done, season them with flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<p>Melt butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Carefully crack eggs into the skillet and let cook until whites have almost set, about 1 minute. Add water, cover skillet with a lid or cookie sheet, reduce heat to medium-low, and let cook until whites have set, yolks are still runny, and some of white has set over yolk, 1 to 2 more minutes. Remove lid and transfer eggs to a serving plate. Garnish with pepper and flaky salt, if desired. Serve immediately.</p>
